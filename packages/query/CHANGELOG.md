## [1.35.9] - 2018-10-05
### Fixed
- SF-1119: Register search box with the autocomplete service.
  - The `search-box` component accepts a new prop `register`, which is used to determine if the search box should register itself with the autocomplete service. The `query` component sets this to the value of `props.showSayt`.
