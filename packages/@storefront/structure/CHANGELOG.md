## [Unreleased] [minor]
### Changed
- SF-1197: `gb-filtered-list` now uses a `gb-paged-list` instead of a `gb-list`.
  - The list is paginated to prevent large lists from locking up the display.
  - **Potentially breaking:** Stylesheets relying on `gb-list` being a direct
    child of `gb-filtered-list` (i.e. `gb-filtered-list > gb-list`) will need
    to be changed.
  - Pagination is enabled by default. To disable it, set the `paginated` prop
    on `gb-filtered-list` to `false`.

### Added
- SF-1197: `Pager`, `Pages` and `TerminalPager` components from `@storefront/paging`
  have been moved into this package.
- SF-1197: A new `GenericPaging` component was added as a generic version of
  `Paging` in `@storefront/paging` that does not rely on the store.
- SF-1197: A new `PagedList` component was added to display a paginated list of items.
- SF-1197: `FilteredList` learned the `paginated` prop to enable or disable pagination.
  - It is `true` by default to enable pagination.
