### Added
- SF-1073: Added `selectMatchedRefinements` to `gb-filter-refinement-controls`.

  - Only "orable" navigations will have the "Select All" button available.
  - The `enableSelectAll` property within `gb-filter-refinement-controls` is false by default, so the "Select All" button will be disabled.
  - The `enableSelectAll` property will be configurable in a future release, but at this time will remain disabled.
